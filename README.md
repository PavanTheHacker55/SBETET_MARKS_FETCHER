4. After Downloding is completed, place the downloaded selenium executable file in ```C:/``` drive by creating a new folder and make sure to copy the path of that folder. 
5. if you done with step 3, Now Open the [main.py](https://github.com/PavanTheHacker55/SBETET_MARKS_FETCHER/blob/main/main.py) file and make the following changes... <br>
   ðŸ”° At line 4 replace ```<your_browser_name>``` with your browser name (Note: all letters must be smallcase).<br>
   ðŸ”° At line 12 change the value to no.of students in your class (simply, strenght of your section), at line 11 don't modify the value ðŸ˜…. </br>
   ðŸ”° At line 13 change the ```<your_branch_code>``` value accordingly, and at line 14 replace ```<batch_code>``` with your college code (batch code). </br>
